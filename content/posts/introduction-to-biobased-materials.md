There just aren't enough elephants in the world for a comparison, so we'll stick with 7 billion humans for now. The truth is, if we want to achieve a sustainable future, we've a long way to go. But there are optimistic signs everywhere, green shoots that will change this planet for the better. Join us as we delve deep into a brave, new postplastic world.

# Introduction to Biobased Materials

Biobased materials represent a revolutionary approach to sustainable manufacturing and product development. These materials, derived from renewable biological resources, offer promising alternatives to traditional petroleum-based products while reducing environmental impact.

## What Are Biobased Materials?

Biobased materials are products derived partially or entirely from biomass, such as plants, trees, or animals. These materials can be:

- Agricultural residues
- Wood and forest products
- Marine materials
- Biological waste products
